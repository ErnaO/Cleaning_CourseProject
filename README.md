# Readme for the Course Project of 'Getting and Cleaning Data'

In this readme you will find the description of the steps I made to get from the raw data to the cleaned data. The raw data was downloaded via the Coursera-link.

## Contents
The repo contains the following files:
- README.md: a description of the steps and the document you're currently reading
- run_analysis.R: the R script that is used to transform the raw data into the tidy data
- CodeBook.md: the codebook with the descriptions of the variables
- CleanedSet.txt: The resulting tidy data set

## Data cleaning steps

### Data initalization

### Merging the data (step 1)

### Use appropriate variable names (step 4)

### Only use variable with respect to mean and standard deviations (step 2)

### Use descriptive activity names (step 3)

### Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (step 5)

### Write the output
